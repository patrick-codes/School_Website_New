                                        To create a conducive educational environment that empowers our students to
                                        aspire towards and achieve great heights. This is achieved through the provision
                                        of a comprehensive, world-class curriculum that fosters critical thinking,
                                        self-motivation, and personal development, while also encouraging creativity and
                                        innovation. Our goal is to educate learners in the principles of godliness and
                                        imbue them with a sense of morality and purpose.
                                        As educators, we have a rewarding and challenging career. We are rewarded by the
                                        joy of children’s laughter and by watching them grow into independent, unique
                                        individuals. We are inspired by our ability each day to help children meet new
                                        challenges, learn new things and discover the world around them.

                                        Our inspirations are our children. We are here for them and we will give them
                                        nothing but the best. We can be trusted to be the second parents to your
                                        children.

                                        This is our ministry, we love it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Message From The CEO
                                        Crown & Glory International School is an educational institution made up of well trained
                                        teachers, students and their parents to constitute a unique family. Ours is a
                                        family that is happy as our name denotes.

                                        We nurture children from the Pre-school to Junior High School (toddlers to
                                        adolescents) through total education. In addition to academic excellence, we
                                        view arts and the social life of our students as equally important. This is
                                        evidenced through our diverse co- curricular activities available in the school
                                        for students such as drama, music, dance, life skills, creativity and
                                        volunteerism. As such, we raise independent, confident and assertive leaders
                                        ready for the 21st Century.
